#Element Buffer Objects
This program is the same as the 'Triangles and Shaders' one, except that it uses an Element Buffer Object, where you can use this buffer to store indicies of repeated vertices rather than each vertex separately.
For drawing a square, 6 verticies are needed, but using an EBO only 4 need to be specified, so it is much more efficient, moreso in larger examples of course.
