# Material Maps
Using the material structs from earlier, just removing the diffuse and material vectors, and replacing them with a single `sampler2D`, allows us to sample directly from a texture to generate a map, and will be able to do more interesting things later.<br>
For now, adding this to the fragment shader, and using it in the ambient and diffuse lighting vectors (like this: `vec3 ambient = light.ambient * vec3(texture(material.diffuse, TexCoords));` and `vec3 diffuse = diff * light.diffuse * vec3(texture(material.diffuse, TexCoords));`) sets the precedence for more interesting effects, like specular maps.
