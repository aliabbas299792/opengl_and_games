A few webpages on my domain erewhon.xyz, in the /game/ subdirectory, to sign up to the game.
The data is then stored in a csv file, which's structure is explained in the appropriately named file.
Basic HTML/CSS and PHP was used in this bit, could've used some JavaScript to make it look better and feel better, but it's basically irrelevant to my project so no point.

Also installed mailutils and setup postfix to use to send confirmation emails.

Only a few minor errors corrected easily (logic errors), everything else was fine.
