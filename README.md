# What I'm going to do
I'm probably going to aim towards a 2D multiplayer pixel RPG game.
To do this I'll need to make use of TCP sockets and Threads, which I have no prior experience of (in C++, what I'll be using).

I will also need to make use of databases, so I'm using PHP/MySQL.
Later on I'll need to implement audio to the game, as well as graphics for the visual component obviously, so I'll be using software such as GIMP/lots of royalty free stuff for the visuals and royalty free music/hopefully some of my own stuff if I get time.

As of now I'm using TGUI and SFML for code, and other resources listed below:
