# Model Loading
Firstly, I will from this point forwards be developing for windows exclusively, due to complications with my old graphics card and the drivers, or possibly some underlying syntax issue, which has prevented from my attempts at achieving model loading from reaching fruition.<br>
Though it should be noted, that I have now a decent amount of experience in developing for Ubuntu, and, despite the fact that I will no longer be able to continue, it has definitely helped me in other Linux based projects which I have undertaken (like programming a TCP socket server), so this was no an entirely fruitless endeavour.
<br>
The entire final project will be Windows only.
